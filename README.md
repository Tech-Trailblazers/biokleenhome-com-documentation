# 🌿 BioKleen SDS / MSDS Documentation

> “Cleaner homes, clearer knowledge.”

This repository gathers and shares Safety Data Sheets (SDS / MSDS) for **BioKleen**’s line of natural cleaning products. We aim to make chemical safety data more open, usable, and helpful — for families, students, researchers, first responders, and curious folks everywhere.

## 📄 What’s Inside

BioKleen offers a variety of green cleaning products with published SDSs that follow OSHA’s Hazard Communication Standard. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
These SDS documents typically include:

- Chemical composition & ingredient listings
- Hazard identification & warning statements
- First aid & emergency guidance
- Fire / reactivity / stability information
- Spill / cleanup advice
- Handling, storage, and safe-use recommendations
- Exposure controls / personal protection suggestions

For example: their **Glass Cleaner** SDS describes hazards like eye irritation, precautions, ingredients like vinegar, surfactants, etc. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
And their **Bowl Kleen** SDS shows detail on physical, ecological, and regulatory information. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## 🎯 Why This Repository Exists

While BioKleen publishes SDSs and ingredient data on its website, the information is often:

- Dispersed across many product pages
- Primarily in PDF form, which is less friendly to searching, cross-referencing, or automated tools
- Not always obvious in structure for developers, researchers, or emergency users

Our goals:

- **Collect & centralize** all available BioKleen SDSs in one place
- **Organize & index** them to make lookup easier
- **Enable use cases** in education, safety tools, AI / ML, and emergency response
- **Support transparency & community** — making safety data more accessible to everyone
